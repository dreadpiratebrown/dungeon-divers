# TO DO

- Readjust weapon stats to creature levels
- Readjust creature stats
- Treasures - fix articles; reduce encounters

- More traveling text
- Is there a story? What else to do besides fight monsters? Quests? SEE GAMEPLAY REVISION BELOW
- Player customization - validation
- Bestiary
- Treasure maps
- Sound?
- More than one fighter
- More than one fiend
- Meta stats - fiends killed, “steps” taken, etc - SHOW ON DEATH SCREEN, INCLUDE GOLD & FAME
- Monster drops
- Puzzles?
- Traps?
- Crafting? Big lift.
- Sort inventory?
- Inventory limit?
- Critical hits?
- Write tests
- Goblin is too powerful
- Create a debugger/testing room/commands
- Autosave - periodic? on navigate away?
- UI updates/better design
- Tutorial guides
- Might need to put a prompt on the exit tile in case it blocks a tunnel
- Fame
  - Reach certain levels of dungeon (10s)
  - Defeat certain creatures / defeat first of each type of creature
  - Reach certain number of steps (1000s)
  - Find certain treasures

Test play: too much gold. Cost steps for items too small. Too many treasure encounters. Leveling is too fast.

## Gameplay Revision

- Gameplay similar to Void Tyrant
- Start game in offices of "Dungeon Delvers Inc."
- Need an overarching goal to aim for, something big and difficult
  - Defeat a big bad?
  - Destroy a cult?
  - Find a legendary treasure?
  - No matter what, should be very deep in the dungeon
- When starting, it's a new business, no amenities
  - As money is earned, can buy things like starting equipment & magic
  - Take on small quests to earn more money & fame
- Choose a hero to go through the dungeon
  - Go as deep as you can, fight as many fiends as you can
  - Need to make fiends stronger so there's more risk
  - If hero dies, back to office, player gets the money
    - Recovery team? Magic? Why not equipment?
- Shop does not have all inventory at once, should get more as game goes on
